* Devise a general way for contact importing and exporting. Problems to be
  resolved:

  * Various systems have some kind unique ID for contacts, how these will be
    generated?

  * How to merge duplicate contacts on imports? By extending? How to detect
    duplicates?

* Add support for export to Mutt aliases file. This should include possibility
  to print it to STDOUT so it can be used dynamically.

* Add support for import/export of vCard.

* Add support for import/export from Google.

  * API documentation: https://developers.google.com/contacts/v3/

* Add support for contact merging from command line.

* Add support for git similar to pass.

  * This functionality should be optional, i.e. everything should work if git
    is not installed or if contacts directory is not a git repository.

  * Automatically commit after every modification.

  * Create a git "pass through" sub-command `con-rs git <arguments to git>`.
